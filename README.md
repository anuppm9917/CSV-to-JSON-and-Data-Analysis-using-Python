# Data-Processing-and-CSV-to-JSON-using-Python
Welcome to our collaborative project aimed at processing data and converting it from CSV to JSON format for a Point of Sale (POS) system. Below are the detailed steps to achieve this task successfully:

# Step 1: Data Processing
**Data Collection:** Gather the CSV data containing relevant information for the POS system.

**Data Cleansing:** Use Python and libraries such as pandas and numpy to cleanse the data. This involves tasks like removing duplicates, handling missing values (NaN), and ensuring data consistency.

**Data Validation:** Validate the processed data to ensure its accuracy and integrity. Utilize pandas methods like head(), info(), describe(), and isnull() to gain insights into the dataset.

**Data Transformation:** Convert all object data types into integer format to prepare the data for further processing and analysis.

# Step 2: Convert CSV to JSON
**CSV to JSON Conversion:** Once the data is cleansed and validated, it's time to convert it from CSV to JSON format.

**Python Scripting:** Write a Python script to read the processed CSV data and convert it into JSON format using libraries like csv and json.

**JSON Output:** Generate a JSON file containing the transformed data in a structured format suitable for integration with the POS system.


# Conclusion:
By following these step-by-step instructions, you'll be able to efficiently process the data, convert it from CSV to JSON format, and seamlessly integrate it into the POS system. Happy coding!
